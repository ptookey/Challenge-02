# Challenge02

## Description

This was the second challenge of the bootcamp, having students construct a basic portfolio from scratch. While partaking in this challenge one can get very familiar with html and css. While frustrating this proved very helpful in getting to understand the two languages even more.

## Usage

This can be used to reference back to basic construction of web pages. It can also be updated and improved upon over time.
