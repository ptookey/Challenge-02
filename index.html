                <p>My name is Peter Tookey, and I decided to change my occupation after five years of working in retail stores. I have always liked problem solving and have been good with logical thinking so I decided to try programming. Through hobbies like photography and graphic design, Iâ€™ve learned to train my eye towards details.  In retail, I learned to apply that importance of details make a product standout. This actively gave me a head start in the programming world because everything is so detail oriented. By utilizing my natural talents as well as what my past experiences have taught me, I am able to efficiently navigate this new field. This website is a means to display what I have achieved so far and as I am always learning new things, it is always being improved upon.</p>
